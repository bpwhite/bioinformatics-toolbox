I. Toolbox Overview
	1. What is this toolbox?
	
	If BioPerl is the glue of bioinformatics, then Bioinformatics Toolbox (BTBox) 
	is a series of already glued together programs, with lots of additions on 
	top of BioPerl.

II. DNA Barcoding
	1. dnab_condense.pl
		
		This script takes an input of aligned FASTSA sequences and outputs 
		representative sequences of distinct haplotypes, and the number of 
		those distinct haplotypes at each location. Input sequences must be formatted
		in the following input format from the example.
		
		Example: 
		
		Input: SampleID|Name|Location
		#####################################################
		>10-SCCWRP-4787|Simulium|19354
		ACTTTA.....

		This script implements out the following algorithm:
			1. Reduce sequences to distinct haplotype. Distinct haplotypes are
			those haplotyes that differ by nucleotide differences rather than 
			by gaps, spaces, or extra/special/different characters. In other 
			words, these are truly distinct haplotypes.
			2. Iterates through those distinct haplotypes and determines how 
			many locations that haplotype is found at.
			3. Determines how many individuals share that haplotype at each 
			location.
			4. Outputs in FASTA a haplotype identification number (HaplotypeID), 
			a representative sequence from the haplotype (RepSeq), a 
			representative name from the haplotype (RepName), the location, and 
			the abundance of individuals sharing that haplotype at that location.
		
	2. dnab_species_delimitation.pl
	
	This script inputs a FASTA file of aligned sequences and outputs species-level
	putative delimitations (AKA. Molecular Operational Taxonomic Units MOTUs). The
	input requirements are that the sequence ID's must follow a particular format
	outlined below.
V. 
	8.  seq_convert_genbank.pl
	8a. Parameters
		-query = COI_full, 16S_full, ND2_full, etc.
		-voucher-only = 1, only download sequences with a voucher tag
	8a. Common commands
		1. Download all COI sequences for a taxa, limit the number of sequences 
		per batch to 500, and give the output file a name:
		seq_convert_genbank.pl 	-query COI_full 
								-voucher-only 1 
								-batch-cap 500 
								-term Gastropoda
								-outp Gastropoda_COI
