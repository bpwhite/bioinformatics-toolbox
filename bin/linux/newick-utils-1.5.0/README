The Newick Utilities are a suite of programs for working with Newick-formatted
phylogenetic trees.

Documentation

See in subdirectory 'doc'.

Installing
==========

Binaries
--------

If you have a binaries distribution (that is, with a name like
newick-utils-x.y.z-linux-x86-64.tar.gz), you do not have to compile. The
binaries are in ./src ; they all have names that start with nw_, so you can do 

$ sudo cp src/nw_* /usr/local/bin	# or wherever you want

You can test the programs by cd'ing to ./tests, and doing the following:

$ for test in test*.sh; do ./$test; done


Source
------

If you have a source-only distribution, or if you want to build the binaries
yourself, it's the familiar

$ ./configure
$ make
$ make check	# optional
$ sudo make install

See in the manual (doc/nwutils_tutorial.pdf) for details.
